## Final notes

This is made to fit my personal use using Ubuntu 20.04 Minimal Install, as I always have intenet available, this script is based on available internet as well;
I finish write this README at 02:45 a.m., so... sorry for the grammar error if you find one ':D
Why "run.sh" and not "install.sh"? Less characters = Less time wasted
